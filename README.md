# Feed Reader

This is the fourth project of the intermediate JavaScript section for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

We are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The goal is to write tests against the code using Jasmine. These test the business logic of the app as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

Here is the project's [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

# How to run the app

To run this code you need to install Jasmine either locally or globally:
```
# Local installation:
npm install --save-dev jasmine

# Global installation
npm install -g jasmine
```
Clone this repository to your computer and go to the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/Fa-v/feedreader.git
cd feedreader/
````
Then, open the index.html file in your browser.
